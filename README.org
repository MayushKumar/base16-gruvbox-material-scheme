* Gruvbox Material for base16
  This is a [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][base16]] port of the amazing [[https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material-vscode][Gruvbox Material]] color scheme by [[https://github.com/sainnhe][sainnhe]], which is a lot easier on the eyes than the original [[https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox][Gruvbox ]]due to its low contrast colors.
  I have tried my best to reproduce the theme as closely as possible.
